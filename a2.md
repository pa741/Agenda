**Slide Title: Introduction to Technological Aspects Related to Configuration Management**



**Main Content:**



1. **Understanding Configuration Management:**

   - **Definition:** Configuration Management (CM) is the process of systematically handling changes to a system to maintain its integrity over time.

   - **Purpose:** Ensures that the IT infrastructure performs as expected, remains secure, and is consistently maintained.



2. **Technological Foundations:**

   - **Historical Context:** 

     - **Traditional Systems Management:** Initially, manual and isolated efforts to manage configurations.

     - **Evolution to Modern CM Tools:** Rise of automation and integration tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack that streamline and standardize configuration processes.

   - **Role in IT Infrastructure:**

     - **Automation and Consistency:** Automates configuration tasks, ensuring consistent application across all systems.

     - **Version Control:** Maintains records of configuration changes to track history and aid in rollback if necessary.



3. **User Experience:**

   - **Streamlined Operations:**

     - **Efficiency Gains:** Automation reduces the need for manual interventions, minimizing errors and freeing up IT staff for other tasks.

     - **Faster Deployments:** Quick and reliable implementation of configurations across multiple systems.

   - **Enhanced Security:**

     - **Consistent Security Settings:** Standardizes security configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities.

     - **Change Management:** Tracks and controls changes to prevent unauthorized modifications.



**Visuals:**

- **Timeline Illustration:** Show the progression from manual configuration management to modern automated tools.

- **Icons/Symbols:** Represent automation, consistency, and security (e.g., gear for automation, shield for security).

- **Diagram Showing User Impact:** Highlight improved efficiency and security.
